### What is Machine Learning?

> The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
> – Arthur Samuel

More recently:

> A computer program is said to learn from experience E, with respect to some task T, and some performance measure P, if its performance on T as measured by P improves with experience E.
> – Tom Mitchel

Example: playing checkers.

- E = the experience of playing many games of checkers
- T = the task of playing checkers.
- P = the probability that the program will win the next game.

Types of machine learning:

- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- (Reinforcement learning)
- (Recommender systems)
